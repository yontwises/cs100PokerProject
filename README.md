  Title of the Project: Poker.io.
  
C:
  Possibly hybrid between web and mobile. If not a web will be the least.
  
D:
  It uses a deck of cards and a system for keeping track how much a user has gained and lost. Additionally, the software is able to show what poker hand rating you have. In these trying times, sometimes this poker game will stand as a reminder of Las Vegas and its exhilerating games in its Casinos.

E:
  Language we plan on using: C++. We want to use an interface that lets users input the bet and possibly see the cards that are being given to a persons hand. Mimicking that of a regular poker game in real life. 

F:
  Input involves planning how much you are betting in poker
  Output: Essentially is the combinations of cards that come out, showing whether it is winning hand or not.
